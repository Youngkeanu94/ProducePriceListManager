This C# program demonstrates file handling and data manipulation. It uses an ArrayList to store produce items with prices, writes them to a file, and then appends additional items. The program also reads back the file contents, displaying each line with a count. Additionally, it includes a custom method to count the number of lines in a file. This example is a practical demonstration of managing and processing a list of items with prices, showcasing skills in file I/O and data structures in C#.
